TODO:

1. Make the listing work form work. Verify the fields and add them to DB 
2. Make the stepper work by adding it to the DB
- Should the listings have a complex location field? When we search them by municipality state etc.
3. Create an endpoint for adding listings
4. Make sure we filter the listings after that
5. Add to query params the rent/sale mode and the page field on query params
6. Make the listings actually listable
7. Work on the single page listing to make it better

1. Use middleware for auth where you can to prevent dynamic routes 
2. Make progress work with percentages in adding new listing
3. Fix where after update and then going into next steps the values are old, 
but on refresh they work
