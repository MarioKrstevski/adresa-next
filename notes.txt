TODO:

x 1. Make the listing work form work. Verify the fields and add them to DB 
x 2. Make the stepper work by adding it to the DB
x - Should the listings have a complex location field? When we search them by municipality state etc.
x 3. Create an endpoint for adding listings
4. Make sure we filter the listings after that
5. Add to query params the rent/sale mode field on query params
5.1. Add to query params the sorting mode field on query params
5.2. Add to query params the page open mode field on query params

6. Make the listings actually listable
7. Work on the single page listing to make it better

1. Use middleware for auth where you can to prevent dynamic routes 
2. Make progress work with percentages in editing and new listing
2.1 Add arbrirary percent values of completion for the field
3. Fix where after update and then going into next steps the values are old, 
but on refresh they work
4. Handle if images are deleted or to reorder them
